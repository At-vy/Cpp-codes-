# C++ DSA Practice 🚀

Welcome to my repository!  
This is a curated collection of my daily C++ codes, problem solutions, and notes from my #DSAStreak journey. The goal is to **learn, share, and grow** while building strong foundations in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

---

## 📌 What's Inside
- ✅ Solutions to LeetCode problems (e.g., arrays, DP, number theory, combinatorics)
- ✅ Dry runs and step-by-step explanations for tricky problems
- ✅ Debugging notes and best practices in C++
- ✅ Explorations of modular arithmetic, STL, and algorithmic efficiency

## 🎯 Goals
- Maintain a **daily coding streak** (#DSAStreak)
- Share clear, accessible solutions for learners
- Document debugging strategies and runtime error fixes
- Build a portfolio of problem-solving skills in C++
